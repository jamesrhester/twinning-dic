twinning-dic
============

This repository records the development of the IUCr twinning dictionary. As of Feb 14th, 2014, datanames from
this dictionary may be used in data files and programs without danger that they will change in the future.

Due to changes in line termination between operating systems, differences between versions are best displayed by ignoring
whitespace differences.
